# Markdown

Dok comes with two commonmark extensions pre-installed. These are initiated inside of `AppServiceProvider.php` and their config is managed at `config/statamic/markdown.php`.

You can reference the commonmark documentation for extra information on either the [Table of Contents](https://commonmark.thephpleague.com/2.6/extensions/table-of-contents/) or [Heading Permalink](https://commonmark.thephpleague.com/2.6/extensions/heading-permalinks/) extensions.
