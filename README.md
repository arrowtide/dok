### Projects and versions
You can host multiple projects and manage different versions for each project. This is handled through the releases collection. To add a new project or version, simply create a new entry in the collection and configure the required fields.

### Statamic as a content source
Wanna just write markdown directly to Statamic? Yup, you can do that.

### GitHub as a content source
If you'd like to host your documentation within a project repository to keep everything centralized, Dok makes the process simple. All you need is a GitHub Personal Access Token and a small update to your configuration file. Once that's done, you can easily link entries to their corresponding resource paths.

Content is linked to the Entry using a Computed Value.

### Styling
Dok comes with a light and dark theme, along with a full set of custom typography styles all using **Tailwind v4**. This means there is **no Tailwind configuration file**, just CSS files. Yay ðŸŽ‰.

### Browser support
Dok supports the latest versions of all major browsers. We use progressive enhancement where possible.

### Compiling Assets
By default, we use a simple Vite configuration that comes with every new Statamic site when using the CLI tool so you should feel right at home.

`npm run dev` - Watches your content, rebuilds, and refreshes your browser so you can instantly see the changes.

`npm run build` - Build for production
